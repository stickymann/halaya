Use before function instead of constuctor, major change from version 2.x


__construct() method - here was the problem. 
When it stays in my Controller, Request object is not constructed. 
When I replace it with before() method as You mentioned, everything is correct. 
And Yes, $this->req = Request::current() can be omitted.
